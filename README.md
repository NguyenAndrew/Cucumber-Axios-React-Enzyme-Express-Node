Q: Can I see my changes live while developing? 

A: Yes! ```npm run dev:all``` uses Create React App to watch changes on the React application and Nodemon to watch changes on the back end server.

Q: What does ```npm run test:watch:all``` do in the Full_Stack directory?

A: This command allows for quick continuous BDD/TDD. To use, open up a second terminal/shell/command prompt, and execute this command there. When changes on src or test are made and saved, the tests will automatically re-run without having to reload the transpiler (Babel). This feature is achieved through babel-watch.
